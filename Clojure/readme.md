# The Beginning
- https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax
- The unit of source code is a Clojure expression, not a Clojure source file
- Source files are read as a series of expressions

In the diagram, (+ 3 4) is read as a list containing the symbol (+) and two numbers (3 and 4). The first element (where + is found) can be called "function position", that is, a place to find the thing to invoke


## Delaying evaluation with quoting
- use symbol '
- '(1,2,3)
- 'x

## Find documentation
- `(doc +) ; + is the function I want to see the documentation`
- Not sure what something is called? Use `(apropos "+")`
- You can also widen your search to include the docstrings themselves with find-doc: `(find-doc "trim")`
- If youâ€™d like to see a full listing of the functions in a particular namespace, you can use the dir function `(dir clojure.repl)`
- To see not only the documentation but the underlying source for any function accessible by the runtime: `(source dir)`
